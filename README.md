# solidity-tutorial

Self-contained and self-guiding tutorial inspired by rustlings.

to start the exercises:
- install packages with `npm install`
- start the tutorial with `npm start`
- for the script to advance to the next exercises remove this line `// I AM NOT DONE`

Right now the three "_exercises_" exercises are basic, unfleshed out, liekly contain incorrect information and serve mostly as proofs of concept of the ability to automatically iterate over them as a student with minnimum effort and focus centered on solidity development.

End goal would be to create a self progressing guide that covers all the topics relating to solidity smart contract development, with comments giving background information, description of how to fix the current exercise, ability to invoke hints if someone is stuck and tests to check if each exercise's solution does what is required.

Topics to add exercises for (in no logical order):
- strings
- functions
- types
- constructors
- public/private/internal/external
- arrays
- storage vs memory
- events
- addresses
- modifiers
- assembly
- inheritance / asbtract class
- structs
- mappings
- libraries
- commenting
- gas
- optimisation 
- security
